# Find the shape of constellations using a fixed point from the farmost left star and find euclidian distances
# Distances from other stars to the right of the fixed star (on the left) would be calculated. 
# When this constellation is rotated, the left-most fixed point would not be the bottom most.
# However, distances remain the same wrt the fixed point.





# Cos rule for triangles
# c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos (angle)
# Thought of as an alternative to using euclidian distances
